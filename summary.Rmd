Methods
=======================================================================

Background {.sidebar}
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Aim: examine species co-occurrence patterns of fish community across the Mediterranean**   

- Principally we want to know whether species co-occurrence patterns are stationary or not.  
- _Stationary_ means that they are constant across environmental gradients, i.e. if the same species pretty much always are observed together or separate.


Column 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Data

- Data from all around the Mediterranean: [MEData](https://belmaker-lab.github.io/medata/)
- Three focal groups of species, each containing four species:

1. Groupers ( _Epinephelus_ and _Serranus_ species)
2. Seabreams ( _Diplodus_ species) 
3. Herbivores (including invasive rabbitfish, data from East Med only)

- Environmental covariates include: temperature (SST), primary productivity, depth and MPA protection.

Column
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Analysis

- Co-occurrence patterns examined with the [`MRFcov` package](https://github.com/nicholasjclark/MRFcov).
- We extract the **R**elative **I**mportance (**RI**) of each of the following:

1. All environmental covariates except MPA
2. MPA protection
3. Biotic associations
4. The interaction between temperature and biotic associations
5. The interaction between MPA protection and biotic associations

### Steps

The results I show here are after the following treatment:

1. Updated MEData with new data from Cyprus
2. Biomass was log-transfomed and scaled
3. Covariates were log-transformed and scaled
4. Ran MRF models for each group of species
5. Extracted RI


Biomass Model Results
=======================================================================

The results here are from spatial models on based on scaled, log-transformed fish biomass. In these models, spatial autocorrelation is accounted for via [Gaussian Process spatial regression splines](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/MRFcov/versions/1.0.38/topics/MRFcov_spatial).

<!-- Create a relimp table to show the results in detail -->
```{r include=FALSE}
relimp_table <- spat_relimp$grps %>% mutate(guild = names(guilds[1])) %>% 
  bind_rows(spat_relimp$dip %>% mutate(guild = names(guilds[2]))) %>% 
  bind_rows(spat_relimp$herb %>% mutate(guild = names(guilds[3]))) %>% 
  relocate(guild, .after = species) %>% 
  pivot_longer(3:length(.)) %>%
  rename(covariate = name, rel_imp = value) %>%
  mutate(focal_species = str_replace_all(species, "\\.", "\\ "),
         covariate = str_replace_all(covariate, "_", "\\ x "),
         covariate = str_replace_all(covariate, "temp", "Temperature"),
         covariate = str_replace_all(covariate, "env", "Environment"),
         covariate = str_replace_all(covariate, "bio", "Biotic Associations"),
         covariate = str_replace_all(covariate, "mpa", "MPA")) %>% 
  # The NAs in 'covariate' are for the species associations interaction with environmental variables that are not temperature
  filter(!is.na(covariate), covariate != "NA") %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = c(focal_species, guild), names_from = covariate, values_from = rel_imp, values_fill = 0) %>% 
  replace(is.na(.), 0)


```

### Groupers

#### 

```{r, fig.width=10}
spat_relimp$grps %>% 
  plot_relimp(guild_col = "grps", guild_name = "Groupers")

```

#### 

- _E. coastae_ is mainly affected by abiotic factors.
- _E. marginatus_ is affected mainly by protection (MPA) and biotic associations.
- Both Epinephelus species are affected by the interaction between MPAs and biotic associations
- Serranus species are not affected by MPAs at all, but are quite affected by biotic associations
- _S. cabrilla_ is also affected by environmental variables.

####

```{r}

relimp_table %>% filter(guild == names(guilds[1])) %>% 
  select("Focal Species" = focal_species, Environment, MPA, "Biotic Associations", 
         "Temperature x Biotic Associations", "MPA x Biotic Associations") %>% 
  formattable(align = c("l", "l", "l", "l", "l", "l"))

```

### Seabreams

####

```{r, fig.width=10}
spat_relimp$dip %>% select(-`NA`) %>% 
  plot_relimp(guild_col = "dip", guild_name = "Seabreams")

```

####

- Diplodus species are not affected by the interaction between MPAs and biotic associations
- Only _D. annularis_ and _D. puntazzo_ are slightly affected by the interaction between temperature and biotic associations
- All species of Displodus, except _D. puntazzo_, are affected mainly by other species
- _D. puntazzo_ is more affected by the environment and protection status than by other species

####

```{r}

relimp_table %>% filter(guild == names(guilds[2])) %>% 
  select("Focal Species" = focal_species, Environment, MPA, "Biotic Associations", 
         "Temperature x Biotic Associations", "MPA x Biotic Associations") %>% 
  formattable(align = c("l", "l", "l", "l", "l", "l"))

```

### Herbivores

####

```{r, fig.width=10}
spat_relimp$herb %>% select(-`NA`) %>% 
  plot_relimp(guild_col = "herb", guild_name = "Herbivores")

```

####

- Herbivorous species are not affected by MPA status (except _Sarpa salpa_)
- The main factor affecting species distribution of herbivores is biotic associations (except _Sarpa salpa_)
- _Sarpa salpa_ is affected mainly by the interaction between other species occurrence (biotic associations) and temperature. 
- Another determinng factor for _Sarpa salpa_ is the environmental conditions, and slightly MPA. 
- Environmental conditions are playing a smaller role in other herbivorous species distribution, as in the case for the species associations and temperature interaction.

####

```{r}
relimp_table %>% filter(guild == names(guilds[3])) %>% 
  select("Focal Species" = focal_species, Environment, MPA, "Biotic Associations", 
         "Temperature x Biotic Associations", "MPA x Biotic Associations") %>% 
  formattable(align = c("l", "l", "l", "l", "l", "l"))

```

Row
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Stationarity vs. Nonstationarity

This part is brought just to get an idea of how much the results point out towards non-stationarity (non-stationary == **FALSE** means stationary).  


```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}

lapply(all_relimp_spat, function(x){
  cov_titles <- tibble(covariate = c("env", "mpa", "bio", "temp_bio", "mpa_bio"),
                       facet.title = factor(c("Environment", "MPA", "Biotic Associations",
                                              "Temp * Biotic", "MPA * Biotic"),
                                            levels = c("Environment", "MPA", "Biotic Associations",
                                                       "Temp * Biotic", "MPA * Biotic")))
  x %>% 
    pivot_longer(2:length(.)) %>%
    rename(covariate = name, rel_imp = value) %>%
    mutate(species = str_replace_all(species, "\\.", "\\ ")) %>%
    group_by(species) %>% nest() %>% 
    mutate(new_data = map(data, function(x) right_join(x, cov_titles, by = "covariate"))) %>% 
    select(-data) %>% unnest(cols = c(new_data)) %>% replace_na(list(rel_imp = 0)) %>% 
    mutate(nonstationary = str_detect(facet.title, "\\*")) %>% 
    group_by(species, nonstationary) %>% 
    na.omit() %>% 
    summarise(sum = sum(rel_imp)) %>% 
    group_by(nonstationary) %>% 
    summarise(mean_RI = mean(sum))
})


```

Overall, we can assume stationarity.

Networks
=======================================================================

The width of the links between species was adjusted with an exponent function to emphasize small differences in association strength.

Groupers {.tabset}
